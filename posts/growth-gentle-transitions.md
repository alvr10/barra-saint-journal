Change has been on my mind lately. Not the dramatic, life-altering kind that makes for compelling stories, but the subtle shifts that happen so gradually we barely notice them until we look back and realize we've become someone new.

## The Quiet Revolution

Six months ago, I was someone who checked her phone the moment she woke up. Today, I find myself reaching for a book instead. The transition happened so slowly I can't pinpoint exactly when it began. One morning I just noticed the difference—and with it, a sense of peace I hadn't realized I was missing.

This is how real growth often works. It's not a sudden transformation but a series of small choices, repeated daily, that compound into something meaningful.

## Learning to Let Go

Part of growing means releasing old versions of ourselves. This isn't always comfortable. I've had to say goodbye to the perfectionist who used to exhaust herself trying to control every outcome. She served a purpose once, but she was also holding me back from experiencing life fully.

The process of letting go is like cleaning out a closet—some things are easy to discard, while others we hold onto long past their usefulness because they feel like part of our identity.

## Embracing the In-Between

What I'm learning is that growth often happens in the transitional spaces—the moments when we're no longer who we were but not quite who we're becoming. These in-between times can feel uncertain, even uncomfortable, but they're also full of possibility.

I'm trying to be more patient with these seasons of becoming, to trust that the process is working even when I can't see the full picture yet.

## Forward, Gently

Growth doesn't have to be forced or rushed. Sometimes the most profound changes happen when we simply create space for them and trust in our own capacity to evolve.
